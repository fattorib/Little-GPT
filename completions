Sloppy Use of Machine Learning Is Causing a ‘Reproducibility Crisis’ in Science AI hype has researchers in fields from medicine to sociology rushing to use techniques that they don’t always understand—causing a wave of spurious results. History shows civil wars to be among the messiest, most horrifying of human affairs. So Princeton professor Arvind Narayanan and his PhD student Sayash Kapoor got suspicious last year when they discovered

that a group of scientists had been using a machine learning algorithm to study how changes in climate affected the weather. The researchers found that their results were “not reproducible and not consistent with each other, ” Narayanan said. That led them to investigate whether there was something wrong with this algorithm. And they did - but they didn’t find anything at all. This year alone, the project has been exposed as a fraud by a team at Harvard University, where the technology used by a professor is now being called into question because it uses human subjects instead of data for the purpose of studying global warming. Despite these flaws, the group decided to publish its findings anyway, hoping that the controversy would die down. But that hasn’t happened. As a result, the group is running out of money and having trouble getting funding from investors. It also needs to decide if it wants to keep working on AI research or if it plans to shut down  Generated Text

a computer program that’s been called “Maclean” for years. The researchers thought it was an algorithm, and the program was using machine learning to make sense of the data in order to answer questions about what people do on their smartphones. “We had no idea that we were going to get something like this - but it seemed very promising, ” Kapoor says. When they tested it out, they noticed that the program had some unusual features: It could figure out who you are based on your age, gender, social network connections, location, job history, previous criminal convictions, where you live, whether or not you smoke marijuana, how much you drink, and even when you watch television shows. Now, a group of students at Princeton University is using the MICT toolkit to analyze more than 5 million Facebook posts from its members, finding hundreds of thousands of false positives. This type of analysis has led

How to minimize distractions when you work from home 

The first step: accept your distractibility

I’ve been working from home for close to 15 years. I also have ADHD. And a lot of streaming subscriptions. And a PlayStation. And hundreds of books. And a partner who also sometimes works from home and is equally aware of the presence of said streaming subscriptions, PlayStation, and books.

The point is that my home is full of
